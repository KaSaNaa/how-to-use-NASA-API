# NASA API Overview

This section contains an introduction to the NASA's Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), some background, and how to set it up with a link to the original API documentation.

## Introduction

API's provide an interface for machines to talk with each other. NASA's APIs allow developers to use NASA's data, such as imagery, for application development. 

## Background

NASA gathers a lot of data - over 15 Terabytes per day! And by a White House mandate this data is free to the public - in a format useful to you. This is where the API comes into play. 

Figuring out the best way to distribute, use, and reuse NASA's data is a problem. NASA's APIs provide a solution by lowering the barrier of entry to people outside NASA to easily manipulate and access the public information. 

A list of NASA APIs beginning with the Astronomy Picture Of The Day (APOD) can be found [here](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod). Here are some of the other APIs available: 

- **[Near Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs)](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#NeoWS):** Access to near Earth asteroid information. 
- **[Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC)](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#EPIC):** Full disc imagery of the Earth. 
- **[Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET)](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#EONET):** Prototype web service providing continously updated natural event metadata, such as storm imagery, gathered from the Earth's surface with the option to link to thematically-related web service-enabled image sources.  
- **[NASA Image and Video Library](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#Images):** Access to the NASA Image and Video Library site at [images.nasa.gov](https://images.nasa.gov/#/)
- **[Sounds (beta)](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#sounds):** Access to space sounds via SoundClound with some of the hassle abstracted away.

## How To Set It Up 

Head on over to [api.NASA.gov](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html) and follow the _applying for an API key_ link to get your personal API key. The process takes ~5 minutes and NASA will email your key to you.

We will be working with these three APIs:

1. [Astronomy Picture Of The Day](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod)
2. [Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET)](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#EONET)
3. [Sounds (beta)](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#sounds)

For each API the following will be covered:

- **Documenation of the API call**
  * What it does
  * What gets sent to the server
  * What get received
- **Example call** 
  * What _they_ (NASA) send back to us
  * What we recieve 
- **Runnable code**

Lets get started!

# Astronomy Picture Of The Day

The APOD is a good API to start with because it's easy to work with. 

## Documenation of the API call

Documentation can be found [here](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod), it is brief but this is understandable for such a simple call. 

### What it does

The APOD call returns a JSON object containing an image or video, date, explanation, and additional metadata. It's our job to make the call and manipulate the received data however we want. 

### What gets sent to the server

APOD uses a GET HTTP request method to request data from the NASA server. GET methods request data from a specified source url. The following shows the HTTP method and the request url.

```markdown
GET https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod
```
We can append parameters to the url to create a query string (name/value pairs) to tell the NASA server who's making the call and if we want something in return besides the defaults. The table below shows the query parameters. 

**Query Parameters**

| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Default Value** | **Description** |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| date | YYYY-MM-DD | _today_ | The date of the APOD image to retrieve |
| hd | bool | False | Retrieve the URL for the high resolution image |
| api_key | string | DEMO_KEY | api.nasa.gov key for expanded usage |

Here is an example query. It begins with the GET request url from above followed a  `?` signifying the beginning of the query string. Follow the link to make the request!

```markdown
https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY
```

Append additional parameters to the querystring with with ` & ` and use ` = ` to create name/value pairs like before.  

Here is an example request for the first APOD image:

```markdown
https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY&date=1995-06-16
```

### What gets received
The request returns information in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). JSON is a syntax used for storing and exchanging data between a client (browser) and a server (NASA database). Here is the JSON object information returned from our last request:

```markdown
{
  "date": "1995-06-16",
  "explanation": "Today's Picture:    Explanation:  If the Earth could somehow be transformed to the ultra-high density of a neutron star , it might appear as it does in the above computer generated figure. Due to the very strong gravitational field, the neutron star distorts light from the background sky greatly. If you look closely, two images of the constellation Orion are visible. The gravity of this particular neutron star is so great that no part of the neutron star is blocked from view - light is pulled around by gravity even from the back of the neutron star.   We keep an  archive file.  Astronomy Picture of the Day is brought to you by  Robert Nemiroff and  Jerry Bonnell . Original material on this page is copyrighted to Robert Nemiroff and Jerry Bonnell.",
  "hdurl": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/e_lens.gif",
  "media_type": "image",
  "service_version": "v1",
  "title": "Neutron Star Earth",
  "url": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/e_lens.gif"
}
```

Properties and their values are in quotes ` " " ` and are seperated with a colon ` : `. This standard notation makes accessing and manipulating the data easy to do with JavaScript.

## Example call 

We have covered how to make a call to the server and what the server sends back to us. Now it time to access the object we recieve, parse it, and use it in our application. We will be using JavaScript and HTML to display our end product. The following is our code in action:

<iframe width="100%" height="700" src="//jsfiddle.net/wilsjame/vc2xwasa/16/embedded/js,html,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Lets cover what's going on here. We begin with the variable list:

```markdown
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
var url = "https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=";
var api_key = "DEMO_KEY";
```
We create a new **XMLHttpRequest** and assign in to req. An XMLHttpRequest provides client functionality for transferring data between a client and server. Think of it as a stream that connects or browser (client) the NASA databases (server). 

Then we create variables to hold the GET request url and API Key. Use your own API KEY by simply changing the **api_key** value. 

```markdown
req.open("GET", url + api_key, true);
```

The XMLHttpRequest **open** method initializes a request. Here are its parameters:

```markdown
req.open(method, url)
```

We are using a **GET** method and have combined the **url** and **api_key** variables to create a valid url. AFter the request is initialized (opened) we send it to the server.

```markdown
req.send();
```
