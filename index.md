# NASA API Overview
This section contains an introduction to the NASA's Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), some background, and how to set it up with a link to the original API documentation.
## Introduction
API's provide an interface for machines to talk with each other. NASA's APIs allow developers to use NASA's data, such as imagery, for application development. 
## Background
NASA gathers a lot of data - over 15 Terabytes per day! And by a White House mandate this is data is free to public - in a format useful to you. This is where the API comes into play. 

Figuring out the best way to distribute, use and reuse NASA's data is a problem. NASA's APIs provide a solution by lowering the barrier of entry to people outside NASA to easily manipulate and access the public information. 
## How To Set It Up 
Head on over to [api.NASA.gov](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html) and follow the **applying for an API key** link to get your personal API key. The process takes ~5 minutes and NASA will email your key to you.


A documentation list of NASA APIs beginning with Astronomy Picture Of The Day (APOD) can be found [here](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod)w. Here are some of the APIs available: 

- **[Near Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs)](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#NeoWS)** description
- **[Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC)](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#EPIC)** description
- **[Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET)](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#EONET)** description

# Where to find additional resources 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/wilsjame/how-to-nasa/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/wilsjame/how-to-nasa/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
