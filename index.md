# What the NASA API is
NASA's APIs allow developers to use NASA's data, such as imagery, eminently accesible for application development. 

NASA has many APIs and this guide will focus on setting up and interacting with the following two:

1. one
2. two

Head on over to [api.NASA.gov](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html) and follow the **applying for an API key** link to get your personal API key. The process takes ~5 minutes and NASA will email your key to you.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/wilsjame/how-to-nasa/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
